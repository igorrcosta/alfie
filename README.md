## <a name="1"></a>1.	Introduction

### <a name="1.1"></a>1.1.	What is alfie?

Alfie (Anonymous/Anchor Loci FIndEr) is an open-source python package 
containing a pipeline that searches complete genome sequences for the maximum 
number of ideal anonymous loci (i.e., single-copy, neutral, and independent 
loci) or for anchor (AE/UCE) loci that also meet the single-copy and 
independence assumptions. It also extracts orthologous sequences from other 
genomes, performs multiple sequence alignments, and outputs ready-to-analyze 
datasets in commonly used formats.

These anonymous loci datasets are ideal for phylogenomic studies that use 
multi-locus coalescent analyses (e.g., phylogeography). AE- and UCE-anchor 
loci are best for phylogenomic studies involving moderate to deep divergences.
The goal of alfie is to be a complete, user-friendly, and flexible 
phylogenomic loci dataset-generating software.


### <a name="1.2"></a>1.2.	How it works?

Alfie utilizes a sequential modular approach, with each step of the pipeline 
being stored in a single module that can be executed with greater flexibility 
in standalone mode.
Many of these steps require external programs, such as BLAST or CLUSTALW. To 
reduce the complexity of the steps the whole pipeline can be run automatically 
using the afie.py script. 

The program contains two main modules: Anonymous loci (AL) finding module and 
an anchor (AE/UCE) loci finding module.

### <a name="1.2.1"></a>1.2.1	Anonymous loci

The AL finding module uses as input a single query genome in FASTA format and 
its associated GTF file. The user must also input one complete genome sequence 
(can be un-annotated) for each individual or species in the study. Alfie finds 
all anonymous regions distant from genomic features (> 200 kb distance, by 
default) to avoid the effects of direct or indirect natural selection (i.e., 
to satisfy the neutrality assumption). 

The program also uses a distance filter (> 200 kb distance, by default) to 
select loci that are likely to be genealogically independent of other sampled 
loci (i.e., satisfy the independent loci assumption). Alfie performs an 
exhaustive search (i.e., it finds every possible anonymous regions for the 
specified parameters in the genomes analyzed). 

After the initial target regions have been found, they are split in small loci 
(default 1 kb). Each piece is searched against subject and query genomes to 
filter duplications and find orthologous regions in all genomes. 

The sequences are then aligned using ClustalW (for each locus) and datasets 
are output in NEXUS (single and multi-locus files), PHYLIP (single and 
multi-locus files), and FASTA formats (single files). These files can then be 
used in a variety of single and multi-locus phylogenomic analyses (e.g., 
species tree analyses). 

The number of output anonymous loci will depend on the two distance filter 
settings (i.e., longer inter-locus distances = fewer output loci and vice-versa).

### <a name="1.2.2"></a>1.2.2	Anchor loci

To use the anchor (AE/UCE) loci finding module, the user must input genome 
sequences (can be un-annotated) for each individual or species in the study. 
Program then finds the locations of target AEs/UCEs in a reference human 
genome with a coordinate file that currently contains 512 vertebrate 
AEs<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> (included in package). The module retrieves 
flanking regions around each AE/UCE element with user-defined length (e.g., 
500 bp). User also specifies distance (bp) between flanking sequences and 
their AEs/UCEs. In general, evolutionary conservation of nucleotide sites 
declines with physical distance from each AE or UCE core region (i.e., 
location in the center of each AE/UCE element). Thus, if the user would like 
more conserved sequences, then the distance from the AE/UCE should be minimal, 
whereas less conserved sequences can be obtained by using longer distance 
settings (e.g., > 500 bp away from the AE/UCE). Paired flanking sequences 
(i.e., candidate AE/UCE loci) are then saved in FASTA files.

The next step is very similar to the second step of the AL finding module: 
AE/UCE candidate loci are used as query sequences in BLAST searches against 
target genomes. Single-copy loci are retained and subsequently aligned. A 
user-specified distance filter retains loci that are likely independent from 
other sampled loci. Each pair of AE/UCE flanking sequences is concatenated to 
form independent loci. Lastly, ALFIE outputs ready-to-analyze datasets in the 
aforementioned formats.

### <a name="1.3"></a>1.3.	What to use alfie for?

Alfie was developed to find hundreds to thousands of single-copy, neutral, and 
independent nuclear markers among whole complete genomes and facilitate 
population genomics studies. A usual user case would use four to ten closely 
related genomes (we recommend no more than 20 million years of divergence to 
allow precise ortholog assignment). As an example, we were able to find about 
300 anonymous loci with orthologs in all four hominoid genomes used (human, 
chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan). 

It is strongly recommended that at least one of the genomes have been 
extensively studied and annotated, presenting a comprehensive GTF file that 
describes the precise location of the main features targeted by natural 
selection, such as genes and regulatory elements.

### <a name="2.1"></a>2.1.	Downloading alfie

Users can download and install the [entire source code from github](https://github.com/igorrcosta/alfie/archive/master.zip) or download the 
docker container with all the dependencies included (available soon). To 
install, simply extract the donwloaded repository file in a folder.

### <a name="2.2"></a>2.2.	Installation requirements

Working versions for each required program can be found on the following links:

* [BLAST](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/legacy/2.2.26/)
* [ClustalW](http://www.clustal.org/download/current/)
* [PhyML](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/binaries.php)

* [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Download)

### <a name="2.3"></a>2.3. Testing your installation

You can test your installation by running alfie on the human and chimpanzee Y 
Chromosomes’ test case. To do that, go to the alfie folder and run the 
following command:

`$>python alfie.py -r test/homo_y.fasta -i test/pan_y.fasta -g test/y.gtf`

This command might take more than a minute to finish, depending on your 
computer speed. A successful run will output 42 candidate loci in the 
test.fasta file, of which only loci 11, 27 and 40 will be selected and aligned.

## <a name="3"></a> 3. Quick Run

To run alfie, you will need a reference genome and GTF file (there are several 
available at [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html)) and some genomes 
to compare against the reference. Example command line:

`$> python alfie.py –r "reference_genome.fasta" -i "genome2.fasta" "genome3.fasta" -g "annotation_file.gtf" -o "output_folder"`

Here the ".fasta" represents the path to the genome files in FASTA format, 
"annotation_file.gtf" is the path to the GTF file and "output_folder" is where 
the loci will be saved.

This command will find several candidade loci in the reference genome, which 
will be stored at a test.fasta file. This candidade loci will be blasted 
against all genomes and the final loci will be saved in several formats.

## <a name="4"></a> 4. Advanced parameters

While alfie can be executed with good results without any additional 
configuration, there are several options that can be implemented in your 
analysis:


Flag                 | Description
---------------------|------------
-r, --reference        | Path to the reference genome FASTA file.
-i, --genomes	       | Path to the other genome files in the FASTA format.
-g, --gtf	       | Path to the GTF file relative to the reference genome.
-o, --outpath	       | Path where all output files will be saved.
-f, --skip_formatdb  | Skip making BLAST databases, use databses from the last run. Can significantly improve analysis speed.
--uce_coordinate     | File with the conserved elements' coordinates, alfie comes with an example file containing the coordinates for 512 vertebrate anchored elements in the human genome. Necessary for Anchored Loci search.
--uce_distance       | Distance between the flanking locus and the beggining of the conserved element. Only used for Anchored Loci search.
--locus_length       | Length of the anonymous loci (default 1000bp). You may increase this length if you are planning to predict primers for these loci.
--max_n              | Maximum percentage of N's in the AL sequence (default 0%). Increase this if you want to find more loci in a low quality reference genome.
--inter_distance     | Minimum distance between ALs (defaut 200000bp).
--gene_distance      | Minimum distance between ALs and genes (default 200000bp). You can use negative numbers to find loci close to the gene regions, for example, -2000 will find loci between 0-2000bp from genes. 
--end_distance       | Minimum distance between ALs and the telomeres (default 10000bp).
--gene_locus         | Use this flag to find loci inside the gene regions (will ignore the gene_distance flag).
--cds                | Only considers the CDS features of GTF files, ignoring all pseudogens, miRNA, etc.
--duplication_cutoff | ALs with 2 hits with identity higher than this will be considered duplicated(default: 50%).
--identity_cutoff    | ALs with a identity higher than this will be considered homologous(default: 90%).
--coverage_cutoff    | BLAST hits must have at least this much %coverage to be considered hits (default: 90%).
--chromossomes       | Chromossomes to be excluded. We recommend excluding all sex chromossomes.
--min_align          | Minimum final alignment length (default 900bp). This will exclude loci that have many Ns in genomes other than the reference.
--remove_gaps        | Remove gaps from the final alignment.
